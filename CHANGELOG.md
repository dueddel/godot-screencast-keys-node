## [1.1.0] - 2021-11-21

### Added
- Setting for how to print pressed keys, it distinguishes between [`scancode`](https://docs.godotengine.org/de/stable/classes/class_inputeventkey.html#class-inputeventkey-property-scancode), [`scancode with modifiers`](https://docs.godotengine.org/de/stable/classes/class_inputeventkey.html#class-inputeventkey-method-get-scancode-with-modifiers), [`physical scancode`](https://docs.godotengine.org/de/stable/classes/class_inputeventkey.html#class-inputeventkey-property-physical-scancode) and [`physical scancode with modifiers`](https://docs.godotengine.org/de/stable/classes/class_inputeventkey.html#class-inputeventkey-method-get-physical-scancode-with-modifiers). That gives users the control to make the plugin print for example *"Control+S"* instead of *"S"* only.
- Icon for the Godot Asset Library
